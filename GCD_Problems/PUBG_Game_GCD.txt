/*
There are N players each with strength A[i]. when player i attack player j, player j strength reduces to max(0, A[j]-A[i]). When a player's strength reaches zero, it loses the game and the game continues in the same manner among other players until only 1 survivor remains.

Can you tell the minimum health last surviving person can have?
Input 1: A = [6, 4] 
second player attack first player. [2, 4]
first player attack second player twice. [2, 0]
